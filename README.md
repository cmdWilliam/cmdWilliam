Hello there ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm William. A mechatronics engineer and developer.

I have years of experience in creating business focused solutions in Sage CRM, Sage 300
and custom .Net Core APIs and integrations on SQL server backend.

I have dabbled heavily into non-relational databases, React-js and PWAs.

My goal is to merge the real and virtual worlds with the new shiny, trending IoT technologies.
Automating as many steps as possible. 
Most often this is a tough process, with many steps, people and slow adoption.

It make's it exciting:boom::exclamation:.

Always learning and researching, to make sure that my code is of good quality.

My Favourite Coding Video is 'Clean Code with Uncle Bob'. Its worth a watchðŸ‘€!
 
Cheers
